# PHQ-9 test implemented in UCBLogo

The PHQ-9 is a [self administered test to help diagnose depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHQ-9).  It's used a lot in the NHS (indeed I must have filled out hundreds for the NHS at this point).  Obviously I am not a medical doctor and if you score consistently high you should contact a GP immediately.

To run, install UCBLogo and then run:

```
ucblogo runphq9.lgo
```

Alternatively, from within UCBLogo you can run:

```
load "phq9logo.lgo
run_phq9
```
